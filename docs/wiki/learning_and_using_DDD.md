# Deep Introduction to Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is not just a software architecture pattern; it's a **philosophy and methodology** that aims to bridge the gap between complex business domains and technical implementation. Its main goal is to produce software that models real-world problems in a maintainable, testable, and scalable way.

## 1. Theoretical Foundations of DDD

### 1.1 What is a Domain?
The **domain** is the sphere of knowledge and activity around which the business revolves. DDD puts the domain and its logic at the center of the software project.

### 1.2 The Ubiquitous Language
A shared language between **developers and domain experts**, embedded in the code itself. Every class, method, and variable should reflect real business terminology.

### 1.3 The Core Premise
Instead of designing systems around technologies (e.g., REST, DB schemas), DDD encourages us to design around **domain logic** and **business capabilities**.

---

## 2. Core Building Blocks

### 2.1 Entities
- Have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states.
- Example: `User`, `Quote`, `BotUser`.

### 2.2 Value Objects
- Described by their attributes.
- Immutable.
- No identity.
- Example: `EmbeddingVector`, `QuoteScore`, `TimestampedMessage`.

### 2.3 Aggregates
- A cluster of entities and value objects treated as a single unit.
- Has a root entity (`Aggregate Root`) that enforces consistency rules.

### 2.4 Repositories
- Interface to access aggregates from storage.
- Mimics a collection.
- Example: `QuoteRepository`, `EmbeddingCacheRepository`.

### 2.5 Domain Services
- Encapsulate domain logic that doesn't fit naturally within an entity or value object.
- Stateless.
- Example: `EmbeddingService`, `VectorStoreService`.

### 2.6 Application Services (Use-Cases)
- Coordinate high-level business operations.
- Not part of the domain model.
- Example: `SearchQuote`, `ReplyWithQuote`, `AnalyzeTone`.

### 2.7 Anti-Corruption Layer
- Protects your domain from external systems or legacy code by translating data and operations.

## 3. Strategic DDD: Bounded Contexts

### 3.1 What is a Bounded Context?
- A boundary within which a particular domain model applies.
- Helps divide a large system into smaller, autonomous parts.
- Different contexts might model the same concepts differently.

### 3.2 Context Maps
- Define how contexts relate to each other: shared kernel, customer/supplier, conformist, etc.

## 4. Practical Application of DDD

### 4.1 Folder Structure (Simplified for Discord Bot)
```
src/
  quote/
    domain/
      quote_manager.py
      embedders.py
    application/
      quote_manager_use_case.py
    infrastructure/
      vector_store.py
  bot/
    bot_service.py
    command_router.py
```

### 4.2 Example: Searching for a Quote in a Discord Bot

- `EmbeddingService` (Domain Service)
- `VectorStoreService` (Domain Service)
- `QuoteManager` (Application orchestrator in pragmatic DDD)
- `QuoteSearchUseCase` (Formal use-case abstraction in doctrinal DDD)
- `BotService` (Entry point, CLI + Discord orchestrator)

### 4.3 How Logic Flows

1. `BotService` is booted by `ServiceManager`.
2. It initializes a `QuoteManager`, passing in `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStoreService`.
3. On receiving a command like `!quote`, the bot calls the orchestrator (either the manager or the use-case).
4. The method embeds the user message, queries the vector store, and returns the best match.

### 4.4 Comparison: Use-Case Class vs Domain Manager

#### Use-Case Class Approach (Doctrinal DDD)
```python
# application/search_quote_use_case.py
class SearchQuoteUseCase:
    def __init__(self, embedder, vector_store, quote_repo):
        self.embedder = embedder
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.quote_repo = quote_repo

    def execute(self, user_input):
        vector = self.embedder.embed([user_input])
        results = self.vector_store.query(vector, top_k=1)
        if not results:
            return "No quote found."
        return self.quote_repo.get_quote(results[0]["id"])
```
In `BotService`:
```python
quote = search_quote_use_case.execute(ctx.message.content)
await ctx.send(quote)
```

#### Domain Manager Approach (Pragmatic DDD)
```python
# domain/quote_manager.py
class QuoteManager:
    def __init__(self, embedder, vector_store, quote_repo):
        self.embedder = embedder
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        self.quote_repo = quote_repo

    def find_relevant_quote(self, user_input):
        vector = self.embedder.embed([user_input])
        results = self.vector_store.query(vector, top_k=1)
        if not results:
            return "No quote found."
        return self.quote_repo.get_quote(results[0]["id"])
```
In `BotService`:
```python
quote = quote_manager.find_relevant_quote(ctx.message.content)
await ctx.send(quote)
```

#### 🧠 Verbose Comparison
| Feature | Use-Case Class | Domain Manager |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Granularity** | One class per action | One class per domain |
| **Testability** | Easy, focused | Also easy if cohesive |
| **Boilerplate** | High (1 class = 1 method) | Low, Pythonic |
| **Scaling** | Very scalable, loggable, DI-friendly | Good enough until orchestration is needed |
| **Mental overhead** | High in small apps | Minimal |
| **DDD purity** | ✅ Ideal | ⚠️ Inspired, not doctrinal |

## 5. Benefits vs Trade-offs

### Benefits
- High alignment between code and business logic
- Easier onboarding with a Ubiquitous Language
- Loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules
- Better testability and maintainability

### Trade-offs
- Learning curve
- Higher up-front design cost
- Can feel heavy in simple CRUD apps
- Boilerplate explosion if over-applied

---

## 6. When to Use DDD

### Use DDD When:
- Your domain is complex and evolving
- Business logic is central to success
- Multiple teams work on different parts of the system

### Avoid DDD When:
- You're building a short-lived, low-risk app
- Your domain is trivial (e.g. simple CRUD)
- You don't have close access to domain experts

---

## 7. Final Thoughts

DDD is not "always the right answer" — but it teaches **thinking tools** and **boundaries** that scale. Even if you don't follow it rigidly, **understanding its mental model** will make you a better architect.

In small Python projects like a Discord bot with AI quote logic:
- Use **manager-style orchestration** to keep development fluid
- Introduce **use-case classes selectively** if logic becomes complex
- Always maintain clean boundaries between application, domain, and infrastructure layers

> Learn the pattern. Then **adapt it intentionally.**
