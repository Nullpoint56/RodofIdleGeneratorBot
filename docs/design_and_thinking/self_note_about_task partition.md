# On Perfectionism, Scope Creep, and Doing "The Right Thing"

**Balancing software quality with sustainable delivery**

I keep running into this pattern—and maybe you do too. I start with a small, well-scoped task—like switching from file
storage to a database—and before I know it, I’m rewriting tangential parts of the system. Not because I’m trying to be
difficult, but because once I see how something *could* be improved, it’s hard to ignore.

I used to think the problem was just bad codebases. But I noticed I behave the same way even in my own projects—the ones
I tried to make “less messy.” That’s when it hit me: it’s not just the code. It’s a mix of my perfectionism and the
natural complexity that comes with software projects.

## The Pattern

When we care about doing things well, we often see more than just the task in front of us. We see the related issues,
the awkward abstractions, the half-baked decisions. Fixing just one thing starts to feel incomplete or even wrong.

But when we follow that instinct without restraint, the scope balloons and deadlines slip. It’s not that we’re doing
anything *wrong*—but without guardrails, it becomes unsustainable.

## Finding Balance: Practicing Restraint Without Compromising Quality

Here’s a simple framework I’m learning to use to help myself balance quality with scope:

### 1. **Notice When You’re Slipping Out of Scope**

As soon as I realize I'm wandering into parts of the code that aren't part of the current task, I try to pause and ask:

> "Is this really needed for the feature to work, or am I trying to fix everything at once?"

### 2. **Mentally Group What You’re Seeing**

Break it down into:

- ✅ **Must-do**: This is essential for the task to succeed
- ⚠️ **Would-be-nice**: Useful improvements but not urgent
- 🧱 **Tech debt**: Deeper, related issues worth logging separately

This helps me stay focused without ignoring what I’ve noticed.

### 3. **Write It Down Instead of Fixing It Now**

If I start identifying useful refactors or system-level improvements, I log them instead of tackling them right away:

```md
TODO: Abstract storage interface to support both DB and file backends
```

This allows me to act on insight without derailing focus.

### 4. **Bring It Up Early if It Feels Big**

If the extra work really feels essential to doing the task right, I try to talk about it sooner than later:

> "While working on this, I realized that we probably need to touch X and Y to avoid problems. Should we expand the
> scope or defer those parts?"

If you're working solo, ask yourself the same thing honestly: should I split this out, or risk delaying the original
task?

### 5. **Leave Room for Future Improvement**

Even when I can’t refactor everything, I try to:

- Add small seams or interfaces that would make future work easier
- Avoid introducing new tight coupling
- Leave clear comments or TODOs

## A Real Example

I ran into this recently while working on
a [feature branch](https://github.com/Nullpoint56/SmartQuoteBot/tree/feat/move-data-to-DB)
for [SmartQuoteBot](https://github.com/Nullpoint56/SmartQuoteBot). The task was intended to be a straightforward
migration from file-based storage to a database. But once I began, I found myself going far beyond that—refactoring the
app's internals, restructuring architectural components, and eventually updating the CI/CD pipeline to support the
ripple effects of those changes.

As a solo developer on the project, I’m also the "scrum master" by default. From that vantage point, I started to
notice: "This task is taking way longer than expected." And that’s a fair assessment—the original objective was limited
in scope and could have been delivered without touching the architecture or pipelines.

From the developer's perspective, the decision made sense: I was uncovering real issues and meaningful improvements. But
in reality, I mistook those improvements as blockers. The need to address them within the same task was driven by my own
perfectionism, my lack of separation between concerns, and my underestimation of the time required for those deep
changes.

This experience was a clear reminder of how easily scope creep can happen—even when you're trying to do something good.
It also highlighted how essential it is to have a personal framework or checklist to keep scope under control when
you're working alone and making all the decisions yourself.

## Final Thought

This isn’t about lowering standards. Wanting to do good work is a strength. But I’m learning that pairing that with
scope awareness, clear task boundaries, and steady iteration helps me be more productive—and a lot less frustrated.

**Note to self:** It’s okay not to fix everything. Document what matters, do what’s needed, and share what you’ve
learned.

This way, I keep growing without burning out.
